# Safe Campus Connect (SCÂ²)

## DeerHacks 2024 Submission

We wanted to make a web app that is useful for students to stay safe on campus. Choosing the Socially Responsible Platforms theme, we were inspired by the theme's implications of a socially responsible social media app, focused on safety and sustainability.
What it does

Safe Campus Connect is a web application that hosts geographically-tied forum posts as markers on UTM campus. Each post can have information about potential hazards, risks, or just cool things around campus. You can filter posts to focus on your friend group, allowing you to always be aware of them.

### How we built it

The frontend is build with React.js. User authentication is serviced by Auth0. The maps, along with the marker pin functionality, are serviced by Google Maps API.

### What we learned

The front end team learned a lot about site routing, particularly as custom forum posts are all their own web page. The back end team learned a lot about web API requests and completions.
